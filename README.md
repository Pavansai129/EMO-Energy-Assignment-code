**The following instructions are required for the tests to pass**

- `Home` route should consist of `/` in the URL path
- `Login` route should consist of `/login` in the URL path
- `Signup` route should consist of `/signup` in the URL path
- No need to use the `BrowserRouter` in `App.js` as we have already included in `index.js`

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
